What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a .git-folder and initializes memory in the system in order for me to use version control. If I donâ€™t do this, git wont work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where everything I am currently working on temporary resides before being commited in the repository. This is useful when you want to commit several files in a single commit, and also it gives you control over exactly what, when and where you save thew commits.
